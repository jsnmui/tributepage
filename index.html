            <h3>The Life of Fatso</h3>
            <ul class="left-align">
              <li>Fatso was a female cat.</li>
              <li>She was born in 1978.</li>
              <li>Her owner was Charlie Schmidt of Spokane, Washington.</li>
              <li>The first Keyboard Cat video was created by Schmidt in 1984.</li>
              <li>Fatso died in 1987.</li>
              <li>Schmidt had since adopted two other cats to become the new "Keyboard Cat" and providing video footage to be used for the meme: Bento until his death in 2018, and the new current Keyboard Cat, Skinny.</li>
